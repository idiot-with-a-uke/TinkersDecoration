# TinkersDecoration

Tinkers' Decoration is a mod for Minecraft 1.12.2, adding to the game one not-so-useful feature: A seared bricks decoration block. It cannot be used for creating a smeltery, and it is purely for decoration. Truely useless. There is, however, the ability to use them to craft covers if you have Thermal Dynamics. (The main reason I actually created this mod)
